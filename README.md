# Tom's Website


- Writing a website with python, tailwind, js, html 
- Wrote an API so we can send data to the site from my desktop application and live update the db


## Create a .env with the api key that I give you.

## install requirements and activate virtual env

## Run server.py to run the web server

## look at manage_server_ui.py or manage_server_command_line.py for how to format the post requests to the api to update data in the dbs. 


All data being updated here is pretty inconsquential.

Will secure db in PRD scenario and rotate api keys
